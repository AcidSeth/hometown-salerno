                    <h3>Minerva Garden</h3>
                    <p><strong>Il Giardino della Minerva</strong>, a hidden gem nestled in the hills of Salerno, once served as a vital source of medicinal plants for the esteemed <strong>Medical School of Salerno</strong>. Among its diverse flora, you'll find ancient remedies like the <em>mystical mandrake</em>, once believed to hold extraordinary powers.</p>
                    
                    <p>Despite their modest size, these gardens offer a serene retreat, perfect for escaping the midday heat. Shaded pergolas and a sophisticated irrigation system—complete with <em>fountains, streams, and natural springs</em>—create a refreshing atmosphere. As you wander through its five terraced levels, the panoramic views of Salerno's old town and harbor unfold before you, each vista more breathtaking than the last.</p>
                    
                    <p>Before you leave, pause to enjoy the garden’s harvest in a charming tearoom with outdoor seating, where the flavors of the plants grown within reach your plate.</p>
